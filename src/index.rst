======================================
Welcome to Nextstrain's documentation!
======================================

Nextstrain is a project to harness the scientific and public health potential
of pathogen genome data.  It's made up of many different parts that all work
together.  Through our website, `nextstrain.org <https://nextstrain.org>`__, we
provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data with powerful
analyses and visualizations showing pathogen evolution and epidemic spread.
Through our open-source software tools, we aim to help you analyze and
visualize your own data in the same way.  Our goal is to aid epidemiological
understanding and improve outbreak response.

Our intent for this documentation site is to cover all parts of Nextstrain,
from viewing the website to producing your own analyses to contributing to
Nextstrain's development.

.. hint::

    If you're new to Nextstrain, start with :doc:`/learn/about`.

    If you're interested in how to interpret what you see on nextstrain.org, start
    with :doc:`/learn/interpret/index`.

    If you're ready to go beyond viewing the website (or just plain curious!),
    start with :doc:`/learn/parts`.

If you have questions, need help, or simply want to say hi, post to our
`discussion forum <https://discussion.nextstrain.org>`__ where the Nextstrain
team and other Nextstrain users provide assistance.  For private inquiries,
`email the Nextstrain team <hello@nextstrain.org>`__.
