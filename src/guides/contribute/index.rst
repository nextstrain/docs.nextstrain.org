Contributing to Nextstrain
==========================

There are many ways to contribute to Nextstrain, and we welcome all contributors!
Read our `Contributing Guide <https://github.com/nextstrain/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#readme>`__ to learn about the kinds of contributions you can make and how to get started.
Please read our `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/nextstrain/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#readme>`__ before starting.

You'll find all our source code repositories used for development within the `Nextstrain GitHub organization <https://github.com/nextstrain>`__.
How-to guides for contributing source code modifications to our projects are kept in each project's respository, sometimes as part of the :file:`README.md`, sometimes as a separate document.
For example:

- `Augur development guide <https://github.com/nextstrain/augur/tree/master/docs/contribute/DEV_DOCS.md#readme>`__
- `Auspice development guide <https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/tree/master/DEV_DOCS.md#readme>`__
- `Nextstrain CLI development guide <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/tree/master/doc/development.md#readme>`__
- `nextstrain.org README <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/blob/master/README.md#readme>`__ (main website)
- `docs.nextstrain.org README <https://github.com/nextstrain/docs.nextstrain.org/blob/master/README.md#readme>`__ (documentation website)

All of these guides generally assume you're working within the context of a local copy of the given repository and are familiar with the command line and the Git version control system.
