==============================
Creating a pathogen repository
==============================

This series of tutorials explains how to create a Nextstrain :term:`pathogen repository`.
These tutorials explore creating workflows in Nextstrain pathogen repositories
that are more complex than the `example Zika workflow <https://github.com/nextstrain/zika-tutorial>`_
covered in the :doc:`earlier tutorial<../creating-a-phylogenetic-workflow>`.

.. note::

   You only need to create a new pathogen repository if it does not already exist or
   you do not want to use an existing Nextstrain pathogen repository.

The tutorials use the Nextstrain `pathogen-repo-guide <https://github.com/nextstrain/pathogen-repo-guide>`_
as the starting point for creating a pathogen repository. Each one covers an individual :term:`workflow`
within the repository.
