.. admonition:: For Windows (WSL) installs
   :class: hint

   You will have two home directories: one for Windows and one for WSL. You can run commands and edit files in either directory, but note the difference in paths when working on Windows vs. WSL.

   1. Windows home directory

      - Windows path: ``C:\Users\<user>\``
      - WSL path: ``/mnt/c/Users/<user>/``

   2. WSL home directory

      - Windows path: ``\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<user>\``
      - WSL path: ``/home/<user>/`` or ``~``
